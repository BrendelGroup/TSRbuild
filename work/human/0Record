#We need to get the genome files set up before we can do anything else:
#
cd HsGENOME
source 0README
cd ..

#The downloads/stripeseq directory contains empty files with names corresponding#to the real read data files on our system.
#To reproduce our analyses, you must populate the directory with the real goods.

#The file samples.tsv assumes implicitely that the read data are accessible
#in the download/stripeseq directory under the listed file name prefixes.

#Let's set up a template Makefile to run the workflow:
#
sed -e "s#{RAWREAD1}.fq#{RAWREAD1}.fastq.gz#; s#{RAWREAD2}.fq#{RAWREAD2}.fastq.gz#;" ../GoSTRIPES/templates/Makefile_Sc >  Makefile_Hs
sed -i -e "s#ScGENOME#HsGENOME#; s#Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.dna_sm.toplevel.fa#Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa#; s#Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.98.gtf#Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98.gtf#; s#Sc_grRNA.fa#Hs_grRNA.fa#; s#scrubSAMfile_OPTIONS  = -s 3 -i 50 -I 1000 -t 1500#scrubSAMfile_OPTIONS  = -s 3 -i 50 -I 100000 -t 100500#;" Makefile_Hs

#And now we set up the sample directories to get the work done:
#
sed -e "s#EXPERIMENT=demo#EXPERIMENT=GSF2268#; s#{READFILESTEM\[i\]}_R1#{READFILESTEM[i]}_R1_001#; s#{READFILESTEM\[i\]}_R2#{READFILESTEM[i]}_R2_001#; s#Makefile_Sc#Makefile_Hs#; " ../GoSTRIPES/templates/xsetup_samples >  xsetup_samples
chmod a+x xsetup_samples
#NOTE: You should adjust the Makefile parameters to choices that are appropriate
#      for your system. As provided, the workflow will run with 8 cores.
./xsetup_samples

#Ok, one more absolutely necessary preparatory step:
#
echo "We must set the rws variable again, as we have moved the gostripes.simg images."
echo "Execute the following (or equivalent):"
echo ""
echo "source ../GoSTRIPES/bin/xworkStripes -b `pwd` -i `pwd`/../gostripes.simg" 
echo ""

#Now for the real work:
#
sed -e "s#EXPERIMENT=demo#EXPERIMENT=GSF2268#; " ../GoSTRIPES/templates/xrun_samples >  xrun_samples
chmod a+x xrun_samples
#NOTE: This should take several hours.
./xrun_samples

#Cleaning up:
#
sed -e "s#EXPERIMENT=demo#EXPERIMENT=GSF2268#; " ../GoSTRIPES/templates/xcleanup_samples >  xcleanup_samples
chmod a+x xcleanup_samples
#NOTE: This will remove temporary files and archive others, greatly reducing disk
#      space usage.
./xcleanup_samples

#NOW:
#
# - you will have records of what was done in the sample directories (see err
# and logfiles/*).
#
# - you should find in this directory bamfiles.tsv, which tabulates the samples
#   and location of the generated *.bam alignment files. bamfiles.tsv can be
#   used as input to TSRchitect for the next workflow step: identification of
#   TSS and TSR; see directory tsr and instructions tsr/0Record.
